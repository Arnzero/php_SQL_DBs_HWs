-- Problem 4

Problem 4-1
 Domain integrity is the refusal of insertion of wrong type.

Problem 4-2
 Entity integrity makes sure our 'records' are unique

Problem 4-3
 Referential integrity keeps consisency between parent
	and child tables, they ride or dye together.

Problem 4-4
  Transaction atomicity Integrity supports commit and rollback
	either completely done or not (LUW).

Problem 4-5
 If a DBMS allows duplicae rows it does not support
	entitiy integrity.

Problem 4-6
 Referential integrity  means you cannot delete an entity that
	depends on another entity.

Problem 4-7
  When a DBMS has automatic backup and recovery capabilities
        it could be said to be providing support for 
	transaction integrity.

Problem 4-8
 Oracle uses the 'check' clause to restrict values
	this is *domain integrity*.

Problem 4-9
 Durability maintains consistent state between trasactions.

Problem 4-10
 Serializability allows for concurrent execution of transactions to be 
	executed serially in some arbitrary order.

Problem 4-11
  Consistency demands a transaction has to transform a database
	from one consistent state to another consistent state.

Problem 4-12
 Durability and Atomicity are responsible for 
	recovery subsystem to ensure.

Problem 4-13
 Isolation ensures that the data used during a transaction cannot
	be used by a second transaction until the first one
	is completed.

Problem 4-14
 Atomicty is the 'all or nothing' property over operations or 
	parts of a transaction.
