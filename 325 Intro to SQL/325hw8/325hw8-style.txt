-- Problem 3a
"THOU SHALT only use an ORDER BY clause for an outermost SELECT
	(not within any sub-select), and it shall be indented
	 to make clear that it (belongs) to the outermost SELECT."

-- Problem 3b
"THOU SHALT only use a GROUP BY clause when one has a good reason
	(usually a computation that you wish done to those groups."

-- Problem 3c
"THOU SHALT surround each nested SELECT statement with a set of 
	parenthesis()."
"THOU SHALT indent nested SELECT statements by at least 3 spaces."

-- Problem 3d
"When using EXISTS or NOT EXISTS
 	- its sub-select argument is EXPECTED to include an
		appropriate correlation condition
	- its sub-select argument is EXPECTED to project a literal
		(since there predicates only (care) if any rows
		 exist in that sub-select's results, NOT those rows'
		 contents, and why bother doing much work
		 projecting those contents)"
