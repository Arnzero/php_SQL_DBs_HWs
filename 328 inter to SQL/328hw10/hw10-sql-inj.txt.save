Sanitize the input:
	We filter everything but acceptable data but it
	gets complex with special chars.

	We can test for sql vulnerabilities by using a quote.	

Use bound parameters:
	We can parse and inject values into an sql statement
	to reduce the chance of altering the string.

Isolate the webserver:
	Design the network infrastructe to assume that the
	bad guy will have full admin access to machine

Query in,data out:
	Let's do one query at a time 

Schema Field Mapping:
	We can guess for fieldlist attributes
	using sql injection by checking if the 
	response is an error or no rows.
