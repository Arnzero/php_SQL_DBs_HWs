Desiginging for accessiblity is not that hard!


Three rules-of-thumb are:
- Support keyboard navigation
	-- people use screen readers
	-- make it more accessible than selecting links

- Don't use color alone to make critical information understandable
	-- use text labels or patterns to highlight
	-- print your graph in black and white

- Use correct markup on your content
	-- Headings establish hierarchy of the content of page
	-- Titles with big font sizes help a reader understand 
		hierarchy
 
Three rules-of-thumb from teach access:

- html tabular tables are better for screen readers
	--do not use CSS to make a table for its uselss for A.R.I.A.
	--is every element forcusable with a keyboard

- Text size
	-- allowing 200% zoom w/0 content loss
	-- increase text without overlap or truncated text
	-- in mobile don't disable pinch and zoom

- Copy Writing
	-- avoid directional language like "below" and "left/right"
	-- use alt text for images
	-- provide explanatory and context-specific text where possible
