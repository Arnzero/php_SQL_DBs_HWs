1 part a
   <link href="my-fave.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />

1 part b
   the 'head' element where we store our meta data

1 part c
   the 'link' element to normalize has to come
	before  the element in the HTML for 
		our own CSS

1 part d
   'em' and '%' are preferred since it relative works
	with the browser as opposed to 'px' or 'pts'

1 part e
   HTML forms should not use the 'table' element for
   layout purposes, CSS should be used for such layout
   instead. The 'table' element should be only used for
   truly-tabular data.
